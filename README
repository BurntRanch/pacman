totally not a mod of pacman :)
do these commands to compile
meson (if you want, you can set prefix, sysconfdir, and localstatedir to [prefix]/usr [prefix]/etc and [prefix]/var respectively) build
ninja -C build
(if u trust me so much that this isnt a troll of pacman that will make it unusable, then do this.)
ninja -C build install
